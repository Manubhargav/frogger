# Project Details
Frogger - Game using JavaScript Game engine.
===============================

## Repository Structure

The repository contains css, images, and js folders, as well as an index.html and a README.md file. Once you have downloaded the files we have provided, you will have to edit app.js to build the game.

* The css folder contains a **style.css** file which you do not need to edit
* The images folder contains the **png image** files, which are used when displaying the game. The images for the player and enemy character are going to be loaded from this folder.
* The js folder also contains the app engine needed - **engine.js** to run the game and a **resources.js** file.
* **index.html** - opening index.html should load the game
* **README.md** contains instructions on how to load and play the game.
